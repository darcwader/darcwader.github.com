  Hello my future self!
I hope the last post is not more than 1 year old. atleast try to write someting on every jan 1.
I had jekyll site, then moved to docuwiki. now seeing that both serve very different purposes, i thought why not start yet again to write in a blog format.
after all, having strict deadlines did help me write about 1 article last time.
would this develop into a full fledged habit&hellip; unlikely.

  I am running a small webapp and wanted a small service to restart the webapp on boot. There are lot of scripts and tutorials out there, but the solution turned out to be pretty simple.

  I am lazy and hate using the mouse. So I decided to use ruby to pull my techcrunch news for me. I just started learning ruby so don&rsquo;t start sending me hate mails if this is too lame for you.

  Git is a filesystem. It is not a cool thing anymore and has become a necessity to understand and get a good hold on using Git. Here are the steps to understand the pull request model.
Basic structure of Pull Request mode {% img /images/posts/2013-04-02/pull-request-structure.png %}

  Photo download is one of the most common feature in iPhone app. Just as Download Manager speeds up due image downloads, we can speed up the image download using multiple requests.
Is it really gonna speed up the download ? Usually single large image loads take considerable time due two 2 factors.
 Server bandwidth - the bandwidth might be fixed bandwidth for each request Client bandwidth - the speed of internet connection  Client bandwidth&rsquo;s effective utilization requires carefully crafted architecture in backend and front end.

  Core data is one of the technologies which elevates the performance and forms an essential part of any iOS app.
Advantages  Performance - easy to fine tune. Model - often overlooked core data awesomeness. a model ties together the data and the view, which gives better consistency while dealing with webservices. Faults - efficient usage of memory . loads only the necessary content. Caching - uniform way to fetch different kinds of data offline.

  Web Trends Generally if you see the browser downloads. we see that last two years there is a gradual decline. Users are preferring to consume through mobile devices rather than browsers.
  Google Browser Trends   Native Facebook released a new native iOS app which uses native controls instead of html5 controls. The user experience improvement was significant and even made zuckerberg admit it was a mistake not to go Native!

  Stop waiting for NFC to pickup, coz its not. with the announcement of iPhone 5 and iOS 6 passbook, Apple has made it clear they are not interested in NFC. which means we need to find alternative solutions for iPhone. Bump which transfers contacts between two phones just by bumping them together has an API. below are the steps to integrate that into your app.
Download the api from

  The different between an educated person and an un-educated person doing a manual job is that the educated person writes his findings down so that the future educated men can read and learn from his knowledge. We have to keep in mind that History repeats itself and Everyone has a History.
