The different between an educated person and an un-educated person doing a manual job is that the educated person writes his findings down so that the future educated men can read and learn from his knowledge. We have to keep in mind that History repeats itself and Everyone has a History.

*Understanding*

When searching for how to improve my writing, I came across an essay by Paul Graham in which he writes. 

{% blockquote Paul Graham http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html %}
Essayer is the French verb meaning "to try" and an essai is an attempt. An essay is something you write to try to figure something out.

When thoughts are written down we connect things which we normally wouldn't. It helps consolidate and explore thoughts much similar to how we perform better under observation (Hawthorne effect). Somebody is staring at you while working, you will perform better. Except peeing, there we freeze.

*Starting Problem*

When we start completing one task, it gives us energy, satisfaction and confidence. Like when we goto gym once and we can go many days, months even! but going on the first day after a long break is 100 times harder. Writing is also similar. It is so long ago in college I had to write essays. Writing is a stimulant to thought. I had to think so much that my thinking gears started squeaking and now I have energy to do more than just write. I want to draw, sketch, paint, go out to photograph, swim. This makes me wonder if writing is an exercise for our brains to stay fit.

*Gradual Change*

Gradual change is a very powerful thing. small but steady writing can bring a lot of change. When the great wall of china was built, I am sure it was built one brick at a time. Now we can see it from the moon. We underestimate the gradual change. This is the reason our teachers and parents goaded us to study and put effort everyday. If only I was emotionally mature for studies I would have learnt with all my capacity. But as life goes, I studied on the last day just enough to score decent marks. I think the whole problem starts with the **Marks** and our **Ranking**. It would be a wonderful and creative world if the grading system was binary. Either you go to next semester or repeat the current semester.

It is these reasons that I've decided to learn to write. Writing gives clarity like tasting the food while cooking. I may not be able to cook a great dish but I wish to learn enough to successfully convey my thoughts to others.
