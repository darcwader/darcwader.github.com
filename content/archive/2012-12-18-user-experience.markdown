## Web Trends

Generally if you see the browser downloads. we see that last two years there is a gradual decline. Users are preferring to consume through mobile devices rather than browsers.

## Native

Facebook released a new native iOS app which uses native controls instead of html5 controls. The user experience improvement was significant and even made zuckerberg admit it was a [mistake not to go Native!][1]

Google maps is another example of why native gives much better user experience than html5. The number of downloads skyrocketed to more than [10million][2] . There are lot of others like flickr, instagram, path which are all native apps.

Wunderlist 2 [goes native][3], the titanium based hybrid app ditched the html5 hybrid approach to give better experience.

Flickr has gone native as well!

User Experience is highly driven by performance. The smoother the app performs the better the user experience will be. No surprise all these apps are ditching hybrid and html5 for Native approach. 

With BaaS providers such as [Parse](http://parse.com) and [Stackmob](http://stackmob.com). Lightning fast deployments from [Heroku](http://heroku.com). Native development has reached low development costs. So much so that hybrid approach isnt such a viable option anymore!

## Technology

What has made native so appealing , technically speaking

* Core Animation - create buttery smooth animations very easily which forms the basis for all Views in iOS. 
* Core Data - create a robust persistence to all data giving good caching behaviour. Create a very good model across complex views making it easier to store complex objects. 
* Instruments - measure minute performance details and quadruple the performance in one fourth of the time.

Not that these are not possible otherwise, given the amount of time it takes to generate a given user experience. it is just not value for money!
