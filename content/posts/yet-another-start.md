Hello my future self!

I hope the last post is not more than 1 year old. atleast try to write someting on every jan 1.

I had jekyll site, then moved to docuwiki. now seeing that both serve very different purposes, i thought why not start yet again to write in a blog format.



after all, having strict deadlines did help me write about 5 articles.

would this develop into a full fledged habit... unlikely.

would i have fun trying to start someting new... definetly.

lets go!
